# Word Sequence
The file dictionary.txt contains one word per line. Subsets of these words can ordered such that,
with the exception of the first word, the second and third letter of each word is identical to the third
last and second last of the preceding word. Words may only be used once within a sequence.
Design algorithms and implement C++ programs that find such sequences separately for words of
length 4 through to words of length 15 characters. Target sequence lengths and CPU times in
seconds are shown in the following tables. You may be able to find longer sequences.


## Usage
Compile and run

```bash
g++ longest-sequence-words.cpp 
./a.out
