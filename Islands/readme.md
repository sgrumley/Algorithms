# Islands

Consider an N-by-N grid in which some squares are occupied by black circles. Two squares belong
to the same group if they share a common edge. In the figure below, there is one group of four
occupied squares, three groups of two occupied squares, and two individual occupied squares.
Assume that the grid is represented by a two-dimensional array. Write a C++ program that does
the following:
* Computes the size of a group when a square in the group is given.
* Computes the number of different groups.
* Lists all groups.
