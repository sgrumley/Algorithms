# Rental Cars

 You are traveling by a cross-country by car and there are n car rentals along
the way. Before starting your journey you are given for each 1<= i < j <= n the fee fi,j
for renting a car from car rental i to car rental j. These fees are arbitrary. For example,
it is possible that f1,3 = 10 and f1,4 = 4. You begin at car rental 1 and must end at car
rental n using rented cars. Your goal is to minimize the rental cost. Give the most
efficient algorithm you can for this problem. 


## Usage
Compile and run

```bash
g++ main.cpp 
./a.out

```
